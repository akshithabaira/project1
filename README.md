In this project we designed and implemented an “AI
Research Paper Summarizer and Reviewer”—an automated
pipeline that:
• retrieves research papers from arXiv using keywords, titles,
or author names,
• converts PDFs into clean text and segments them into
sections,
• generates abstractive summaries using transformer-based
models,
• produces peer-review style feedback in a structured format,
and
• optionally computes ROUGE and BLEU scores for evalua-
tion.
